      "date":"Feb 2020",
      "link":"#",
      "description":"The invention relates to a system to aid the visually impaired in their daily chores. It comprises of two components viz a processing device and an interface unit. A mobile application serves as the interface unit while the processing device is a small single-board computer. The interface unit works on voice commands and screen taps in its entirety. The features provided by the system are currency identification and counting, basic text-reading, text-summarization (to get an essence of a long text), supermarket bill reading, color identification, and business card reading. However, the invention is not only proposed to be limited to these features but is open to addition of other features too."

The processor uses a data bus of 8-bits, an address bus of 5-bits and a RAM of size 32KB. Apart from this, the processor makes use of two general-purpose registers A and B. The operands on which the operation is to be performed are first moved into the two general-purpose registers. The ALU fetches these operands from the registers and performs the desired operation."

Hence the project employs the map-reduce concept using the pyspark framework. Using map-reduce, the processing of a huge dataset in case of association mining can be parallelized over a cluster. Given a set of products, the system returns the associations among them along with their confidence values. The discovery of these associations can help retailers develop marketing strategies by gaining insight into which items are frequently purchased together by customers."
